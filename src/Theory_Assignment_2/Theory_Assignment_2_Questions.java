//    Scenario 1: Course Registration System
//    A university wants to develop a Course Registration System where students can register for courses.
//    The system should have the following:  A Student class with attributes studentId, name, and a list of registered courses.  A Course class with attributes courseId, courseName, and creditHours.  A Registration class that associates students with courses (use Aggregation).
//    Problem Statement:  Draw a class diagram representing the system.  Implement the Student, Course, and Registration classes in Java.  Demonstrate object creation and interaction in a main method.
//
//
//            Scenario 2: Bank Account Management System
//    A bank needs a Bank Account Management System where customers can open and manage their
//    accounts securely. The system should include:  A BankAccount class with private attributes accountNumber, balance, and accountHolderName.  Public methods deposit(double amount), withdraw(double amount), and getBalance().  A SavingsAccount class that extends BankAccount and applies a withdrawal limit.
//    Problem Statement:  Implement the BankAccount and SavingsAccount classes using Encapsulation and
//    Abstraction.  Ensure that balance updates follow data hiding principles.  Provide Java code demonstrating account transactions.
//
//
//    Scenario 3: Employee Management System
//    A company is designing an Employee Management System. Each employee has an Address, which
//    consists of street, city, and zipCode. The Employee class should contain an Address object, demonstrating
//            Composition. Problem Statement:  Implement an Address class with appropriate attributes and a constructor.  Implement an Employee class with an Address field, a constructor for initialization, and a
//    displayInfo() method.  Demonstrate creating an Employee object with an Address and printing its details.
//
//
//    Scenario 4: Library Management System
//    A library wants to develop a Library Management System that allows users to borrow and return books
//while ensuring proper access control.  A LibraryUser class with attributes userId, userName, and a list of borrowed books.  A Book class with attributes bookId, title, and author.  A Library class that maintains a collection of books and manages borrowing and returning (use
//            Composition).
//    Problem Statement:  Implement the LibraryUser, Book, and Library classes using OOP principles.  Ensure proper encapsulation to prevent unauthorized modification of book data.  Demonstrate object creation, book borrowing, and returning operations.
//
//
//    Scenario 5: Hot Dog Stand Sales Tracking System
//    A fast-food business operates several hot dog stands across the city. The company wants to track the daily
//    sales of each stand and monitor their performance. Each stand has:  A unique stand ID.  A counter for the number of hot dogs sold. Problem Statement:  Define an Encapsulated class named HotDogStand that includes private instance variables for
//    standId and hotDogsSold.  Implement a constructor to initialize these values.  Provide a method justSold() that increments the count of sold hot dogs.  Implement a getter method to retrieve the number of hot dogs sold.  Create a main method to simulate at least three hot dog stands, each selling a different number of
//    hot dogs.  Display the total number of hot dogs sold per stand.
